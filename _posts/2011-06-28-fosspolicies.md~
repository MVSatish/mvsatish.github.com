### The Open Source Trend is catching on in the IT and Electronics Space in India, with Enterprises and SME's taking the plunge.

Kerala Govt has been an early mover in utilising the advantages of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in all domains. Even,The enrollment for UID in Kerala was delayed because of the use of proprietary software by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which has been resolved later. It’s a matter of pride that Kerala is the first State to implement Aadhaar using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The launch of Aadhaar is in complete compliance with the Kerala Government’s IT Policy of using FOSS in all aspects of governance.

In recent years, motivating success of Indian FOSS Community is Winning over the fight for Open Standards Policy 
For Building a Knowledgeable Society and encourage Tech savvy, Open Source is the essential component. The Government has to be involved at the adoption, appreciation and contribution level to help the Nascent Indian FOSS Community. It should also create a supportive environment through the right policies for FOSS companies to grow.
Just the implementation of a policy that mandates the use of FOSS in large Govt Projects will spur the demand and Consumption of FOSS.


There Should be Technology Choice and avoidance of Vendor lock-in. It is reported that Computers of Dept of IT, AndhraPradesh(Various Other States also) were suffering from severe Virus-Attacks since long time. Why Govt's Should use huge amounts of public funds to pay royalties, license fee to Proprietary Software Vendors???
And Suffer from Virus attacks/ Restrict their own Freedom?

Various State Governments of India, Please Ponder at this Issue and extend your support to Open Source and Make India "A Global FOSS Hub"

	National Knowledge Network Supports Open Source
	Most of the Internet Products like Google, Wikipedia, Facebook supports and rely on FOSS
	C-DAC is working for FOSS
	Indian Operating System, BOSS is a Pure FOSS Product
