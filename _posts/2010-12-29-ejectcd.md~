Hi Geeks!!!

Today I want to Show you a Simple Program which Ejects your CD ROM Tray and Close it Continuously!!! And How to Compile a Program and Make it Executable!!!!

##Program :


#### //Cd -Rom Tray Eject & Close Program
#### //Program Written by Satish
#### //Licensed Under GPL, Free to Use, Share and Modify/Distribute 

	//Program Start
	main()
	{
	for(;;)
	{
	system("eject");
	system("eject-t");
	}
	return 0;
	}
	//program end


## Compilation Under Linux

1. Open Text Editor & Copy the Above Program and Save it as simple.c
2. Go to the Directory, where you saved the file simple.c using CD command
3. Now Compile the program code is
gcc simple.c -o simple
4. Now You can Find the EXECUTABLE file in the Same Directory.
5. Double Click the EXE file and have fun
