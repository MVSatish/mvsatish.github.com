This Blog is Powered by [Ghost](http://ghost.org) and static site is generated using [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster/).

Ghost is simple, clean and lean. I wanted to host my blog on Github pages while having the advantage of dynamic publishing platform. Buster helps to have best of both worlds, dynamic platform and statically generated site to host on any environment with the capability of serving simple webpages.

Thanks Github Pages for free hosting and cloudflare for the free HTTPS cert and best in class CDN.
